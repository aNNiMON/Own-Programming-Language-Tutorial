# Destructuring assignment

Destructuring assignment allows to define multiple variables for each element of an array or map.

For arrays, value is assigned to variable:

@[code](../../code/basics/destructuring_assignment1.own)

Which is equivalent to:

@[code](../../code/basics/destructuring_assignment2.own)

For maps, key and value are assigned to variable:

@[code](../../code/basics/destructuring_assignment3.own)

To skip value just leave argument empty:

@[code](../../code/basics/destructuring_assignment4.own)
